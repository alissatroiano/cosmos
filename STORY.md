# Cosmos

Cosmos is a space game that challenges players to control a planet's movement in orbit and avoid colliding with other planets. Cosmos was built for [AWS's Game Builder Challenge](https://awsdevchallenge.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=your-open-hackathons&ref_content=Submissions+open).

## Inspiration

Cosmos was built for the [AWS Game Builder Challenge](https://awsdevchallenge.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=your-open-hackathons&ref_content=Submissions+open) hosted by [Devpost](https://awsdevchallenge.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=your-open-hackathons&ref_content=Submissions+open). The AWS hackathon challenges developers to use Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI-powered assistant, to build games faster.

I needed to build a functional, visually appealing game by the given deadline and was eager to learn a new framework. Fortunately, the [AWS Game Builder Challenge](https://awsdevchallenge.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=your-open-hackathons&ref_content=Submissions+open) gives contestants the opportunity to use Amazon Q Developer, a powerful AI assistant, to speed up development. Because of this, I decided to build a game based on something I really love (space) using a technology I had never used: Three.js.

## What It Does

The main objective of Cosmos is to use the game's mechanics to move around your orbit as many times as possible without colliding with other planets on the adjacent orbit.

### How to Play

#### **If you're playing on Desktop:**
- Use the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys on your keyboard to control your planet's movement.  
  - Use Arrow Up to accelerate.  
  - Use Arrow Down to decelerate.  

#### **If you're playing on Mobile:**
- Tap the arrow up button on the bottom-left corner of the screen to accelerate.  
- Tap the arrow down button on the bottom-left corner of the screen to decelerate.  

#### Game Over
- You lose Cosmos if and when you collide with another planet object.  
- When the game ends, press `R` on your keyboard or click the reload icon to play again!  

## How I Built It

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhgBwJn1bQw) to learn the basics of Three.js and get a general idea of how my planets would move in orbit. Once I had a general understanding of the framework, I prompted Amazon Q to change the game's mechanics, create a space theme, and generate spherical objects to represent planets.

### Working with Q

As a member of GitHub Copilot's Beta Testing team in 2022, I already knew that prompts must be detailed, logical, and specific when working with a local IDE assistant like Amazon Q Developer.

#### Scene
I used simple inline code comments with common Three.js terms to prompt Q into setting up the scene, camera, and renderer accordingly.  

#### UX
I then prompted Q to create a dark background and add stars to simulate an outer space environment.  

#### Game Mechanics
Rather than simply revising the tutorial code, I used inline comments, Amazon Q IDE Chat, and my own JavaScript knowledge to configure the game mechanics and bind user actions to keyboard keys and HTML elements.  

The code generated by Q was usually sufficient for a working game, but I updated variables to match my vision for how Cosmos should work. For example, I adjusted the planet acceleration and deceleration speed, orbit design, scoring system, and planet radius.  

#### Tech Stack & Dev Tools Used:
- Three.js  
- Amazon Q  
- CSS  
- HTML  
- Amazon Amplify  
- Node/NPM  
- Git/GitHub  

## Challenges I Ran Into

### Orbit Track Setup
Defining velocity, acceleration, and player controls was easy with Q, but I encountered challenges when prompting Q to create two adjacent and overlapping orbit tracks.

I wrote several sets of inline comments, instructing Q to create two adjacent tracks that overlap in the center. I also explained in the chat that the player planet would need to move on track 1 while enemy planets will spawn on track 2. I also explained how this was necessary to create the game I wanted to use. Despite multiple attempts, the AI repeatedly delivered circular tracks that were either connected or concentric.

Here are some examples of prompts and what they resulted in:

```javascript
// Setup two track parameters to look like an infinity symbol, so the user's challenge is to avoid colliding with the other planets (using up/down keyboard acceleration controls)
```
